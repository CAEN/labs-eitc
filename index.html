<p>
Today, even though students have their own personal computing devices,
demand for student computing has moved to more specialized computing
environments. For example access to more capable design-oriented
computers, facility collaboration and innovative instructional space.
We now consider computing labs as a component of a more formal
facilities family that we refer to as Instructional and Learning
Environments.

Student computing labs are now more specialized and have several
variations that address different computing requirements. The current
student computing facility types were developed over time as a result of
discussions with students groups and faculty, analyzing lab and software
usage data, adapting to licensing changes in the software industry, and
observing trends in other institutions.
